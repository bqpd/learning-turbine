# learning-turbine

This repository holds work from the MIT CSAIL Robot Locomotion lab on a wind turbine using inference to maximize power and minimize vibration. In particular the folders contain code for putting a BMA180 accelerometer on the tip of the blade and using an arduino to relay the accleration data over serial to a linux computer which logs them.

The turbine was built by [Zico Kolter](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kolter/doku.php?id=home), a postdoc in the lab at the time of writing, and more details are available in his [paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kolter/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=pubs:kolter-turbine11.pdf).
