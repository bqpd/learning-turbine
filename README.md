# learning-turbine

This repository holds my work at the MIT CSAIL Robot Locomotion lab on a wind turbine using inference to maximize power and minimize vibration.

The turbine was built by [Zico Kolter](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kolter/doku.php?id=home), a postdoc in the lab at the time of writing, and more details are available in his [paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kolter/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=pubs:kolter-turbine11.pdf).
